        <ul>Against AI Art
          <li>When AI technology gets better, there will always be grief in human replacement of that work. Art is no different.</li>
          <li>Additionally, many of these services are free to use so the question becomes: When will AI become more efficient than hiring people to do Art?</li>
          <li>If AI samples off an artist's style, is that legal for the developers to just use that without permission?</li>
          <li>What if AI are able to completely replicate famous, and expensive paintins? It might encourage fraud.</li>
